		<h1>Publication</h1>
		<h2>Publication perfect</h2>
		<p>Your English is good but not perfect. I have spent many years amending the texts of international academics so that their messages are clear, concise and coherent.</p>
		<p>As academic publication becomes ever more competitive, and journal editors are increasingly inundated with manuscripts, it has become even more important that your paper is perfect. If you get the science right, I can ensure that it reads well and is free from errors. I will never change the meaning of your text but I will make sure there are no ambiguities, that your sentences are clear and to the point, and that your text is well-structured and flows logically.</p>
		<p>Don't risk having your paper rejected because the editor isn’t sure of your message &mdash; let me perfect your manuscript for you.</p>
		<p>I have a PhD in English and have spent the last 20 years teaching and editing &mdash; particularly in the field of public health. My skill is in checking, amending and perfecting your text to make sure that you communicate your ideas to an international audience in a way that is clear, concise and coherent. If you send me your text, I mark it up using ‘track changes’ so that you can accept or reject the changes as you wish. I also make extensive use of the ‘comments’ facility so that I can check ambiguities or make suggestions for improvements and fine-tuning of the text. As journal citations become increasingly important, it is vital that you give yourself the best possible chance of successful publication in high impact journals. Similarly, when you have a presentation to give, I can ensure that your slides are word perfect and give you an online rehearsal to make certain that you are too.</p>
		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<p>Most of my work is done electronically. You send me your manuscript &mdash; I look at it and give you an estimate of the cost. If the cost is acceptable, you advance me the fee by PayPal and I begin work! I edit in Microsoft Word, using track changes so that you can see where I’ve made alterations. I will never change the meaning of your work &mdash; if I find ambiguities I will make suggestions for clarification using the ‘comments’ facility and we can discuss these to ensure that your text is clear. My aim is to make this a two-way process so that you understand why I’ve made changes and can improve your writing skills at the same time as benefiting from the improvements to your text.</p>
