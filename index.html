		<p>For the last 20 years I have worked as a teacher, editor and project manager. I have taught academic English in China, Japan, Afghanistan and Brazil, as well as running the English for Academic Purposes course at LSHTM. Working for the ELT School in London, I have taught businessmen and women from Hitachi Europe, Daiwa, Mitsubishi and numerous others.   I am lucky to be able to establish a good rapport with students easily and my years of experience enable me to develop teaching materials that are entirely appropriate for my students, whether they are receiving individual tuition or group training. Many of my students have commented on their surprise at how interesting learning English can be.</p>

		<p>My editing skills began with training at Book House in 1987 and were honed on numerous PhD theses (including my own) and Masters dissertations. These days, in addition to theses and dissertations I edit journal articles, slide presentations and technical reports by students and academics from all over the world. I also edit technical reports for WHO, ICDDR,B and the Malaria Consortium.</p>

		<h2>Why use my services?</h2>
		<h3>Publication perfect</h3>
		<p>Your English is good but not perfect. I have spent many years amending the texts of international academics so that their messages are clear, concise and coherent.</p>
		<p>As academic publication becomes ever more competitive, and journal editors are increasingly inundated with manuscripts, it has become even more important that your paper is perfect. If you get the science right, I can ensure that it reads well and is free from errors. I will never change the meaning of your text but I will make sure there are no ambiguities, that your sentences are clear and to the point, and that your text is well-structured and flows logically.</p>
		<p>Don't risk having your paper rejected because the editor isn’t sure of your message &mdash; let me perfect your manuscript for you.</p>
		<p>I have a PhD in English and have spent the last 20 years teaching and editing &mdash; particularly in the field of public health. My skill is in checking, amending and perfecting your text to make sure that you communicate your ideas to an international audience in a way that is clear, concise and coherent. If you send me your text, I mark it up using ‘track changes’ so that you can accept or reject the changes as you wish. I also make extensive use of the ‘comments’ facility so that I can check ambiguities or make suggestions for improvements and fine-tuning of the text. As journal citations become increasingly important, it is vital that you give yourself the best possible chance of successful publication in high impact journals. Similarly, when you have a presentation to give, I can ensure that your slides are word perfect and give you an online rehearsal to make certain that you are too.</p>
		<p>Much of this time has been spent at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in all three of the School’s faculties which has given me a unique understanding of the staff, students and academic writing requirements in the field of public health.</p>
		<h3>How does it work?</h3>
		<p>Most of my work is done electronically. You send me your manuscript &mdash; I look at it and give you an estimate of the cost. If the cost is acceptable, you advance me the fee by PayPal and I begin work! I edit in Microsoft Word, using track changes so that you can see where I’ve made alterations. I will never change the meaning of your work &mdash; if I find ambiguities I will make suggestions for clarification using the ‘comments’ facility and we can discuss these to ensure that your text is clear. My aim is to make this a two-way process so that you understand why I’ve made changes and can improve your writing skills at the same time as benefiting from the improvements to your text.</p>
		<h3>Training</h3>
		<h4>Individual tuition</h4>
		<p>I give individual tuition in English for Academic Purposes, Intercultural Communication and Business English. These are usually Skype lessons &mdash; and we initially discuss your needs by email. You may want to improve your spoken or written English generally or in a more specific area, such as English for socializing, emailing in English, oral presentation skills, writing for publication or speaking on the phone. Sometimes students want to prepare for a specific event such as a conference presentation, others simply want to improve their communication skills for email and phone.  Whether you want an intensive one week course or one lesson per week for several weeks, your needs can be accommodated.</p>
		<h4>Group courses</h4>
		<p>My group courses take place in your organization. I have delivered courses in universities, commercial research institutions, government offices and engineering companies.  We can develop the course to suit your particular needs &mdash; whether it is an intensive weekend or a slower-paced week long course with opportunities for private study.</p>
		<p>If you are interested in a group course, we need to develop a clear understanding of your requirements and design a course to address your specific needs. It could be a combination of writing and speaking skills for business purposes or a closely-focused course on academic vocabulary for a research paper.</p>
