		<h2>Individual tuition</h2>
		<p>I give individual tuition in English for Academic Purposes, Intercultural Communication and Business English. These are usually Skype lessons &mdash; and we initially discuss your needs by email. You may want to improve your spoken or written English generally or in a more specific area, such as English for socializing, emailing in English, oral presentation skills, writing for publication or speaking on the phone. Sometimes students want to prepare for a specific event such as a conference presentation, others simply want to improve their communication skills for email and phone.  Whether you want an intensive one week course or one lesson per week for several weeks, your needs can be accommodated.</p>
		<p>To discuss your needs further, please contact me using the <a href="contact.php">contact form</a>.</p>

		<h2>Group courses</h2>
		<p>My group courses take place in your organization. I have delivered courses in universities, commercial research institutions, government offices and engineering companies.  We can develop the course to suit your particular needs &mdash; whether it is an intensive weekend or a slower-paced week long course with opportunities for private study.</p>

		<p>If you are interested in a group course, we need to develop a clear understanding of your requirements and design a course to address your specific needs. It could be a combination of writing and speaking skills for business purposes or a closely-focused course on academic vocabulary for a research paper.</p>
